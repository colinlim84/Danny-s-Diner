## Business Task
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.
Through these insights, Danny aims to forge deeper connects with his customers and deliver more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Question and Solution

> 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?


````sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(price) total_amount_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
USING(product_id)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
````

#### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` tables as the required information `sales.customer_id` and `menu.price` are from both tables.
- Use **SUM** to compute `total amount spent`.
- Group the aggregated results by `sales.customer_id`. 

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

> 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

````sql
SELECT
    customer_id, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT TO_CHAR(order_date, 'dd-mm-yy')) order_date

> 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
